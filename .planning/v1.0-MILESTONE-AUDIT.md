## Cross-Phase Integration

| Integration Point | Status |
|-------------------|--------|
| Phase 1 tokens → Phase 2-5 components | PASS |
| Phase 3 glows + Phase 2 surfaces | PASS |
| Phase 5 animations → Phase 1 reduced motion | PASS |
| Tailwind utilities → CSS custom properties | PASS |
| PageTransition → layout.tsx | PASS |
| Section components → variants.ts | PASS |

**Integration Score:** 7/7

## E2E Flow Verification

| Flow | Steps | Status |
|------|-------|--------|
| Homepage Experience | Hero → Stats → Projects → Timeline | PASS |
| Navigation | Card click → Transition → Detail → Back | PASS |
| Accessibility | Tab → Focus ring → Reduced motion | PASS |

**Flow Score:** 3/3

## Orphaned Tokens (Non-Blocking)

| Token | Location | Reason |
|-------|----------|--------|
| `surface-sunken` | globals.css, tailwind.config.ts | Future use (inset wells) |
| `status-error` | globals.css, tailwind.config.ts | Future use (form validation) |

These are intentional forward-compatible tokens, not tech debt.

## Tech Debt

**None identified.** All implementations are complete without stubs, placeholders, or TODO comments.

## Human Verification Notes

Phase 5 (Motion + Scroll) received human verification approval:
- Page transitions: Smooth, no hydration replay
- Scroll animations: Sections animate once, stagger works
- Project card links: Navigation works correctly
- Reduced motion: System preference respected
- Overall polish: Approved as "subtle and professional"

## Build Status

```
npm run build: SUCCESS
- TypeScript: No errors
- ESLint: No warnings
- Pages generated: 14/14
```

## Blockers

**None.** Milestone is ready for completion.

## Recommendations

1. **Proceed to completion** - All requirements met, no blockers
2. **Consider v2 planning** - Light/dark mode toggle deferred to v2
3. **Monitor LayoutRouterContext** - Uses internal Next.js API; fallback plan documented in STATE.md
