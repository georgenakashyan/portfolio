<objective>
Add scroll-triggered reveal animations to all sections below the fold.

Purpose: Create subtle, professional animations that enhance user experience as content scrolls into view. Sections should fade/slide in once when first visible, with staggered animations for grids and lists.

Output: All major sections animate on scroll with proper reduced motion support.

  <name>Task 1: Add scroll reveal to StatsBar and FeaturedProjects</name>
  <files>
    app/components/sections/StatsBar.tsx
    app/components/sections/FeaturedProjects.tsx
  </files>
  <action>
Add scroll-triggered animations to StatsBar and FeaturedProjects sections.

**StatsBar.tsx changes:**
1. Import `motion, useReducedMotion` from "framer-motion"
2. Import variants from "@/app/components/animation/variants"
3. Add `useReducedMotion()` hook
4. Wrap the stats grid in a `motion.div` with:
   - variants: shouldReduceMotion ? reducedContainerVariants : staggerContainerVariants
   - initial="hidden"
   - whileInView="visible"
   - viewport={{ once: true, amount: 0.2 }}
5. Wrap each stat Card in `motion.div` with:
   - variants: shouldReduceMotion ? reducedItemVariants : staggerItemVariants
   - (No initial/animate needed - inherited from parent)

**FeaturedProjects.tsx changes:**
1. Import `motion, useReducedMotion` from "framer-motion"
2. Import variants from "@/app/components/animation/variants"
3. Add `useReducedMotion()` hook
4. Wrap the section header div in `motion.div` with:
   - variants: shouldReduceMotion ? reducedFadeVariants : fadeUpVariants
   - initial="hidden"
   - whileInView="visible"
   - viewport={{ once: true, amount: 0.5 }}
5. Wrap the projects grid in `motion.div` with:
   - variants: shouldReduceMotion ? reducedContainerVariants : staggerContainerVariants
   - initial="hidden"
   - whileInView="visible"
   - viewport={{ once: true, amount: 0.1 }}
6. Wrap each Link (project card) in `motion.div` with:
   - variants: shouldReduceMotion ? reducedItemVariants : staggerItemVariants
   - Keep the Link's existing className

Note: Keep Link as outer element for SEO, wrap in motion.div for animation. The "group" class should stay on Link.
  </action>
  <verify>
1. Run `npm run dev`
2. Scroll down on home page - StatsBar cards should stagger in
3. Continue scrolling - FeaturedProjects header fades in, then cards stagger in
4. Scroll back up and down - animations should NOT replay
5. Enable prefers-reduced-motion - sections should appear instantly
  </verify>
  <done>StatsBar and FeaturedProjects animate on scroll with staggered reveals and reduced motion support</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Add scroll reveal to QuickTimeline, SkillsMatrix, and ExperienceTimeline</name>
  <files>
    app/components/sections/QuickTimeline.tsx
    app/components/sections/SkillsMatrix.tsx
    app/components/sections/ExperienceTimeline.tsx
  </files>
  <action>
Add scroll-triggered animations to remaining sections.

**QuickTimeline.tsx changes:**
1. Import `motion, useReducedMotion` from "framer-motion"
2. Import variants from "@/app/components/animation/variants"
3. Add `useReducedMotion()` hook
4. Wrap section header div in `motion.div` with fadeUpVariants pattern
5. Wrap timeline items grid in `motion.div` with staggerContainerVariants pattern
6. Wrap each experience card wrapper div in `motion.div` with staggerItemVariants
   - Keep the existing div structure with timeline dot positioning

**SkillsMatrix.tsx changes:**
1. Import `motion, useReducedMotion` from "framer-motion"
2. Import variants from "@/app/components/animation/variants"
3. Add `useReducedMotion()` hook
4. Wrap section header div in `motion.div` with fadeUpVariants pattern
5. Wrap the outer space-y-12 div in `motion.div` with staggerContainerVariants
6. Wrap each category div in `motion.div` with staggerItemVariants
   - Skills within categories do NOT need individual animation (too many items, would be slow)

**ExperienceTimeline.tsx changes:**
1. Import `motion, useReducedMotion` from "framer-motion"
2. Import variants from "@/app/components/animation/variants"
3. Add `useReducedMotion()` hook
4. Wrap section header div in `motion.div` with fadeUpVariants pattern
5. Wrap the space-y-12 div (timeline items container) in `motion.div` with staggerContainerVariants
6. Wrap each experience wrapper div in `motion.div` with staggerItemVariants
   - Keep the existing div structure with timeline dot positioning

For all sections:
- viewport={{ once: true, amount: 0.2 }} for containers
- viewport={{ once: true, amount: 0.5 }} for headers (smaller elements)
- Use amount: 0.1 for large grids to trigger earlier
  </action>
  <verify>
1. Run `npm run dev`
2. Navigate to home page, scroll through all sections
3. Each section header should fade in, then items stagger in
4. Navigate to /experience page - ExperienceTimeline should animate
5. All animations should play once only
6. Test reduced motion preference - all should appear instantly
  </verify>
  <done>All major sections have scroll-triggered reveal animations with proper stagger and reduced motion support</done>
</task>

</tasks>

1. `npm run build` completes without errors
2. Home page scroll test:
   - StatsBar cards stagger in when scrolled into view
   - FeaturedProjects header fades, then cards stagger
   - QuickTimeline header fades, then cards stagger
   - SkillsMatrix header fades, then categories stagger
3. /experience page scroll test:
   - ExperienceTimeline header fades, then entries stagger
4. Scroll back up - no animations replay
5. Reduced motion test - all sections appear instantly
6. Performance: No jank during scroll (only opacity/transform animated)
</verification>

<success_criteria>
1. All 5 section files import and use variants from animation/variants.ts
2. All sections use whileInView with viewport={{ once: true }}
3. Headers use fadeUpVariants, grids/lists use staggerContainerVariants + staggerItemVariants
4. All sections respect useReducedMotion with reduced variants
5. Animations are smooth with no visible jank
6. INT-02 requirement satisfied (sections fade/slide into view on scroll)
</success_criteria>

<output>
After completion, create `.planning/phases/05-motion-scroll/05-02-SUMMARY.md`
