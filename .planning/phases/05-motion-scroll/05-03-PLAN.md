<objective>
Verify INT-01 (clickable project cards) and overall motion polish.

Purpose: Confirm that project cards are already clickable links (per existing FeaturedProjects.tsx implementation) and verify the complete motion experience is polished and professional.

Output: Verified working interactions meeting all Phase 5 success criteria.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Verify INT-01 project card links</name>
  <files></files>
  <action>
Verify that FeaturedProjects cards are clickable and navigate to project detail pages.

Check existing implementation in FeaturedProjects.tsx:
- Each project card should be wrapped in a Link component
- Link href should be `/projects/${project.slug}`
- Clicking the card should navigate to the project detail page

Run verification:
1. Start dev server: `npm run dev`
2. Navigate to home page
3. Scroll to Featured Projects section
4. Click on first project card
5. Verify navigation to /projects/[slug] page
6. Use browser back button
7. Click on second project card
8. Verify navigation works

If any issues found, document them. If working correctly, confirm INT-01 is satisfied.

  <verify>
`curl -s http://localhost:3000 | grep -o 'href="/projects/[^"]*"' | head -3` shows project links exist in HTML

  <what-built>Complete Phase 5 motion and scroll experience</what-built>
  <how-to-verify>
Test the complete motion experience:

1. **Page Transitions (INT-03 + hydration fix)**
   - Open http://localhost:3000
   - Refresh page - should NOT see fade animation on load
   - Click "View All Projects" link
   - Verify smooth fade transition to /projects page
   - Click browser back button
   - Click a project card to go to detail page
   - Verify transitions feel smooth and professional

2. **Scroll Reveal Animations (INT-02)**
   - Go to home page (http://localhost:3000)
   - Scroll down slowly
   - Verify each section animates in:
     - StatsBar: cards should stagger in
     - Featured Projects: header fades, then cards stagger
     - Quick Timeline: header fades, then cards stagger
     - Skills Matrix: header fades, then categories stagger
   - Scroll back up and down - animations should NOT replay

3. **Project Card Links (INT-01)**
   - Click on any project card in Featured Projects
   - Verify it navigates to the project detail page
   - Verify page transition animation plays

4. **Reduced Motion**
   - Enable "Reduce motion" in system preferences
   - Refresh page and scroll - all animations should be instant
   - Navigate between pages - transitions should be instant

5. **Overall Polish**
   - Animations feel subtle and professional (not flashy)
   - No jank or stutter during scroll
   - Timing feels right (not too slow, not too fast)

  <resume-signal>Type "approved" if all checks pass, or describe any issues found</resume-signal>

<verification>
1. INT-01: Project cards clickable and navigate to detail pages
2. INT-02: Sections animate on scroll with fade/slide effects
3. INT-03: Page transitions smooth, no hydration replay
4. Reduced motion: All animations respect user preference
5. Polish: Animations subtle, professional, no jank
</verification>

<success_criteria>
1. All three INT requirements verified working
2. Page transition hydration bug fixed (pending todo resolved)
3. Human verification confirms polish level meets "professional, not flashy"
4. Phase 5 complete and ready for final project wrap-up
</success_criteria>
